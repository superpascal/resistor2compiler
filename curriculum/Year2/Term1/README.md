# Year 2, Term 1: Advanced Logic and Memory Concepts

## Overview

Term 1 of Year 2 builds on Year 1 foundations to introduce memory concepts and control systems. Students learn how computers store and retrieve data, and how control signals orchestrate operations.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Term 1, students will:
- Understand memory chips (EEPROM, RAM) and how they work
- Build and use a Memory Address Register (MAR)
- Store and retrieve data from memory
- Understand basic address decoding
- Build simple state machines and sequencers
- Understand how control signals coordinate operations
- Integrate all Year 1-2 concepts into a "manual computer"

## Week Structure (Compressed: 12 weeks → 9 weeks)

**Note**: All content preserved, delivery compressed for efficiency.

## Materials

### Components
- Memory chips (74LS189 or 8-bit EEPROM like 28C16)
- Registers (74HC173 for MAR)
- DIP switches
- Tri-state buffers (74HC125/244)
- Counters and decoders
- Control logic components

### Tools
- Breadboards
- Multimeter
- Logic analyzer (if available)
- Arduino-based EEPROM programmer (for loading data)

## Assessment

- **Formative**: Weekly practical work and lab reports
- **Summative**: Memory subsystem project (Weeks 1-3)
- **Summative**: State machine project (Weeks 4-6)
- **Final**: Manual computer demonstration (Weeks 7-9)

## Prerequisites

Students must have completed Year 1 and understand:
- Logic gates and combinational circuits
- Sequential circuits (flip-flops, registers, counters)
- System buses and tri-state buffers
- ALU concepts

## Key Concepts

- **Memory**: How data is stored and retrieved
- **Addressing**: How to select specific memory locations
- **Control**: How signals coordinate operations
- **State Machines**: How systems sequence through states
- **Integration**: How all components work together
