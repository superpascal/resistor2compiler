# Week 7-9: Integration and Review - Teaching Guide

## Overview

This teaching guide supports the integration of all Year 1-2 components into a complete "manual computer" and preparation for Year 3 CPU construction.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week-block, students will:
- Integrate all system components
- Understand complete system architecture
- Manually execute simple programs
- Coordinate all control signals
- Be prepared for Year 3 CPU construction

## Prerequisites Check

Before starting, ensure students:
- ✅ Completed all Year 1 labs
- ✅ Completed memory lab (Week 1-3)
- ✅ Completed control concepts lab (Week 4-6)
- ✅ Understand all system components
- ✅ Can work systematically on large projects

## Week-by-Week Breakdown

### Week 9: System Integration

**Theory Session (45 min)**:
- Review all components (registers, ALU, memory, buses)
- System architecture overview
- How components connect
- Signal coordination principles

**Lab Session (90 min)**:
- Plan system layout
- Connect all components
- Connect buses and control signals
- Add status LEDs
- Power up and test subsystems

**Key Points**:
- All components must work together
- Buses connect components
- Control signals coordinate operations
- Systematic approach prevents errors

**Common Questions**:
- Q: How do we organize all this? A: Plan layout first, work systematically
- Q: What if something doesn't work? A: Test each subsystem individually
- Q: How do we avoid errors? A: Double-check connections, label everything

### Week 10: Manual Control Setup

**Theory Session (45 min)**:
- All control signals needed
- Manual control vs automatic control
- Signal coordination
- Control signal reference

**Lab Session (90 min)**:
- Identify all control signals
- Connect manual switches
- Add status LEDs
- Label all switches
- Test each signal
- Create control reference card

**Key Points**:
- Many control signals needed
- Manual control requires careful coordination
- Reference card helps remember signals
- This is what CPU will automate

**Common Questions**:
- Q: How many signals do we need? A: Depends on components (typically 10-15)
- Q: What if we forget a signal? A: Use reference card, test systematically
- Q: Why manual? A: To understand what CPU will do automatically

### Week 11: Manual Program Execution

**Theory Session (45 min)**:
- What is a program?
- Program execution steps
- Manual vs automatic execution
- Example program walkthrough

**Lab Session (90 min)**:
- Load test program into memory
- Execute program step-by-step manually
- Control all signals manually
- Verify each step
- Complete program execution
- Document execution

**Key Points**:
- Programs are sequences of operations
- Each operation needs specific signals
- Manual execution shows how CPU works
- This is exactly what CPU does automatically

**Common Questions**:
- Q: Why do this manually? A: To understand what CPU does automatically
- Q: What if we make a mistake? A: Debug step-by-step, check each signal
- Q: How long does this take? A: Manual is slow, CPU is fast - that's the point!

### Week 12: System Demonstration and Documentation

**Theory Session (45 min)**:
- System architecture documentation
- User guides and technical manuals
- Reflection on learning
- Preparation for Year 3

**Lab Session (90 min)**:
- Run complete program execution
- Demonstrate different operations
- Document system architecture
- Create user guide
- Prepare presentation
- Reflect on learning

**Key Points**:
- Documentation is important
- System should be reproducible
- Reflection reinforces learning
- Ready for automatic CPU (Year 3)

**Common Questions**:
- Q: What should we document? A: Architecture, connections, procedures, troubleshooting
- Q: Why present? A: Share learning, practice communication
- Q: What's next? A: Year 3 - build automatic CPU (SAP-1)

## Teaching Strategies

### Differentiation

**Support for struggling students**:
- Provide system integration checklist
- Pre-label some connections
- Pair with stronger students
- Extra time for integration
- Simplified programs to execute

**Extension for advanced students**:
- Execute more complex programs
- Add output displays
- Design new instructions
- Optimize system layout
- Prepare advanced documentation

### Common Misconceptions

1. **"Integration is just wiring"**
   - Clarify: Requires understanding signal timing, coordination, data flow
   - Show how errors in integration cause system failures

2. **"Manual computer is useless"**
   - Clarify: Teaches exactly how automatic computers work
   - Show that CPU does same thing, just automatically

3. **"We're done learning"**
   - Clarify: This is foundation for CPU construction
   - Preview Year 3: automatic control unit

### Assessment Checkpoints

**Week 9**: Can students integrate all components?
**Week 10**: Can students set up manual control?
**Week 11**: Can students execute program manually?
**Week 12**: Can students demonstrate and document system?

## Final Assessment

**Practical Assessment**:
- Build complete manual computer
- Execute at least two different programs
- Document system architecture
- Present system to class

**Reflection Questions**:
1. How do all components work together?
2. What would make this automatic?
3. What challenges did you face?
4. How does this prepare for CPU?
5. What would you improve?

## Resources

- System architecture templates
- Control signal reference cards
- Program execution checklists
- Documentation templates
- Presentation guidelines

## Next Year

After completing Year 2, students are ready for Year 3: CPU Construction, where they will build the SAP-1 8-bit computer with automatic control.
