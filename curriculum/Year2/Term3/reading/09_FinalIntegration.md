# Chapter 9: Final Integration and Year 3 Preparation

## Introduction

Final integration brings everything together. This chapter covers system review, documentation, presentation, and preparation for Year 3 CPU construction.

## Complete System Review

**Review all components**:
- Registers (A, B, MAR)
- ALU (adder/subtractor with flags)
- Memory (RAM/EEPROM)
- Buses (data, address, control)
- Control systems (state machines, microcode)
- I/O systems (input, output)

**Review all concepts**:
- Electronics fundamentals
- Digital logic
- Sequential circuits
- Memory systems
- Control systems
- I/O interfacing
- System integration

**System capabilities**:
- What can the system do?
- What are its limitations?
