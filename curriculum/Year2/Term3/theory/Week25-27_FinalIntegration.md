## Common Misconceptions

1. **"We're done learning"**
   - Clarify: This is foundation for CPU
   - Year 3 builds on this

2. **"CPU is completely different"**
   - Clarify: Uses same components
   - Adds automatic control

3. **"Documentation is optional"**
   - Clarify: Essential for complex systems
   - Professional practice

## Connections to Year 3

- **All Knowledge**: Foundation for CPU
- **All Skills**: Needed for CPU construction
- **System Understanding**: Essential for CPU design
- **Readiness**: Prepared for CPU challenge

## Next Year

After completing Year 2, students are ready for Year 3: CPU Construction, where they will build the SAP-1 8-bit computer with automatic control.
