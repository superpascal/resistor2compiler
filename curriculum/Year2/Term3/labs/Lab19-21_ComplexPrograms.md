# Lab 25-28: Complex Program Execution

## Lab Overview

In this lab, students will design and manually execute complex multi-step programs, demonstrating complete system understanding and preparing for automatic program execution.

## Learning Objectives

- Design complex multi-step programs
- Execute programs manually with proper signal coordination
- Test and verify program correctness
- Debug program execution issues
- Document program execution

## Prerequisites

- Completed Year 2 Terms 1-2 labs
- Understanding of all system components
- Ability to execute simple programs
- Understanding of manual control

## Materials

### Components
- Complete manual computer system
- All components from previous labs
- Program memory (with test data)
- Output display devices
- Documentation materials

### Tools
- Control signal reference
- Program execution checklist
- Documentation templates

## Safety

- Large system - work carefully
- Verify all connections
- Check power distribution

## Lab Sessions

### Session 1: Program Design (Week 25)

**Objective**: Design complex multi-step program

**Steps**:
1. Define program goal (e.g., calculate sum of 3 numbers)
2. Break into operations
3. Identify data locations
4. Plan register usage
5. Sequence operations
6. Create step-by-step procedure
7. Plan test cases

**Expected Result**: Complete program design with all steps documented

**Troubleshooting**:
- If program unclear: Simplify, break into smaller parts
- If data conflicts: Plan register usage carefully
- If sequence wrong: Review operation dependencies

### Session 2: Program Preparation (Week 26)

**Objective**: Prepare system and load program data

**Steps**:
1. Review system status
2. Load test data into memory
3. Set up initial conditions
4. Verify all components working
5. Review control signal reference
6. Practice simple operations
7. Prepare execution checklist

**Expected Result**: System ready, data loaded, ready to execute

**Troubleshooting**:
- If data wrong: Check memory programming
- If system issues: Debug before starting
- If components fail: Fix before proceeding

### Session 3: Program Execution (Week 27)

**Objective**: Execute complex program manually

**Steps**:
1. Execute program step-by-step
2. Control all signals manually
3. Verify each step
4. Check intermediate results
5. Document execution process
6. Handle any errors
7. Complete program execution

**Expected Result**: Program executes correctly, produces expected result

**Troubleshooting**:
- If step fails: Check signals, check data, retry
- If result wrong: Trace back, find error, fix
- If timing issues: Slow down, ensure signals stable

### Session 4: Program Testing and Documentation (Week 28)

**Objective**: Test program thoroughly and document

**Steps**:
1. Test with different data sets
2. Verify all test cases
3. Document program execution
4. Create program documentation
5. Reflect on execution process
6. Identify improvements
7. Prepare presentation

**Expected Result**: Program tested, documented, ready to present

**Troubleshooting**:
- If tests fail: Debug, fix, retest
- If documentation incomplete: Add missing information
- If presentation unclear: Simplify, clarify

## Assessment

### Practical Assessment
- Successfully design complex program
- Execute program correctly
- Test with multiple cases
- Document program execution
- Present program to class

### Lab Report
Students should document:
- Program design and goals
- Step-by-step execution procedure
- Test cases and results
- Any issues encountered
- Reflection on execution process

## Extension Activities

- Design more complex programs
- Optimize program execution
- Add conditional operations (conceptual)
- Create program library

## Next Lab

After completing this lab, students will move to system optimization and debugging (Lab 29-32).
