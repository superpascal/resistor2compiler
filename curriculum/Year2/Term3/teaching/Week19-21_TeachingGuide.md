# Week 25-28: Complex Program Execution - Teaching Guide

## Overview

This teaching guide supports the delivery of complex program execution over 4 weeks. Students design and manually execute complex multi-step programs.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week-block, students will:
- Design complex multi-step programs
- Execute programs manually
- Test and verify programs
- Debug program execution
- Document program execution

## Prerequisites Check

Before starting, ensure students:
- ✅ Completed Year 2 Terms 1-2
- ✅ Can execute simple programs
- ✅ Understand all system components
- ✅ Can coordinate control signals

## Week-by-Week Breakdown

### Week 25: Program Design

**Theory Session (45 min)**:
- Complex program concepts
- Program design process
- Data flow planning
- Operation sequencing

**Lab Session (90 min)**:
- Design complex program
- Break into operations
- Plan data locations
- Sequence operations
- Create procedure

**Key Points**:
- Good design is essential
- Break complex into simple parts
- Plan data flow carefully
- Document design

**Common Questions**:
- Q: How complex should program be? A: 5-10 operations is good
- Q: How do we plan? A: Start with goal, break into steps
- Q: What if we get stuck? A: Simplify, ask for help

### Week 26: Program Preparation

**Theory Session (45 min)**:
- System preparation
- Data loading
- Initial conditions
- Execution readiness

**Lab Session (90 min)**:
- Review system status
- Load test data
- Set up conditions
- Verify components
- Prepare execution

**Key Points**:
- Preparation prevents problems
- Verify everything before starting
- Have reference materials ready
- Practice simple operations first

**Common Questions**:
- Q: What if system has issues? A: Fix before starting
- Q: How much data? A: Enough to test thoroughly
- Q: What if data wrong? A: Check, reload, verify

### Week 27: Program Execution

**Theory Session (45 min)**:
- Execution process
- Signal coordination
- Step verification
- Error handling

**Lab Session (90 min)**:
- Execute program step-by-step
- Control all signals
- Verify each step
- Handle errors
- Complete execution

**Key Points**:
- Take time, be careful
- Verify each step
- Document execution
- Fix errors as they occur

**Common Questions**:
- Q: What if step fails? A: Check signals, retry
- Q: How do we verify? A: Check data, check results
- Q: What if result wrong? A: Trace back, find error

### Week 28: Testing and Documentation

**Theory Session (45 min)**:
- Program testing
- Documentation standards
- Presentation preparation
- Reflection

**Lab Session (90 min)**:
- Test with different data
- Verify all cases
- Document execution
- Create documentation
- Prepare presentation

**Key Points**:
- Test thoroughly
- Document completely
- Reflect on learning
- Prepare to share

**Common Questions**:
- Q: How many tests? A: At least 3 different cases
- Q: What to document? A: Everything: design, execution, results
- Q: How to present? A: Clear, organized, demonstrate

## Teaching Strategies

### Differentiation

**Support for struggling students**:
- Provide program templates
- Simplify program complexity
- Step-by-step execution guide
- Pair with stronger students
- Extra time for execution

**Extension for advanced students**:
- Design more complex programs
- Optimize program execution
- Add conditional operations
- Create program library

### Common Misconceptions

1. **"Programs are just sequences"**
   - Clarify: Programs have structure and logic
   - Show program design importance

2. **"Manual execution is useless"**
   - Clarify: Teaches how CPU works
   - Show value of understanding

3. **"Complex means difficult"**
   - Clarify: Complex means many steps
   - Show breaking into parts

### Assessment Checkpoints

**Week 25**: Can students design complex programs?
**Week 26**: Are students prepared for execution?
**Week 27**: Can students execute programs correctly?
**Week 28**: Can students test and document programs?

## Resources

- Program design templates
- Execution checklists
- Documentation templates
- Presentation guidelines

## Next Week

After completing program execution, students move to optimization and debugging (Week 29-32).
