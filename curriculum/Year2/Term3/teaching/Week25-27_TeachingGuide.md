## Teaching Strategies

### Differentiation

**Support for struggling students**:
- Provide documentation templates
- Simplify presentation requirements
- Extra time for work
- Pair with stronger students
- Support during presentation

**Extension for advanced students**:
- Advanced documentation
- Extended presentation
- Help other students
- Additional projects

### Common Misconceptions

1. **"We're done learning"**
   - Clarify: This is foundation for CPU
   - Year 3 builds on this

2. **"Documentation is optional"**
   - Clarify: Essential for complex systems
   - Professional practice

3. **"CPU is completely different"**
   - Clarify: Uses same components
   - Adds automatic control

### Assessment Checkpoints

**Week 33**: Can students review system completely?
**Week 34**: Can students create professional documentation?
**Week 35**: Are students prepared to present?
**Week 36**: Are students ready for Year 3?

## Final Assessment

**Portfolio Requirements**:
- Complete system documentation
- All lab reports
- Project photos
- Circuit diagrams
- Program examples
- Reflection on learning

**Presentation Requirements**:
- System overview
- Key features
- Demonstration
- Challenges overcome
- Lessons learned

## Resources

- Documentation templates
- Presentation guidelines
- Portfolio checklist
- Year 3 preview materials

## Next Year

After completing Year 2, students are ready for Year 3: CPU Construction, where they will build the SAP-1 8-bit computer with automatic control.
