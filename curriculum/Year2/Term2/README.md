# Year 2, Term 2: Advanced Control Systems and I/O

## Overview

Term 2 of Year 2 extends control concepts and introduces input/output systems. Students build more complex state machines, explore microcode concepts, and learn to interface with external devices.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Term 2, students will:
- Build more complex state machines and sequencers
- Understand microcode ROM concepts
- Implement address decoding for multiple devices
- Interface with simple I/O devices (switches, LEDs, displays)
- Understand memory-mapped I/O
- Build more sophisticated control systems
