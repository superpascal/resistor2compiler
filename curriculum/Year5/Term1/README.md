# Year 5, Term 1: Software Stack Development (After GCSEs)

## Overview

Term 1 of Year 5 begins software development after GCSE exams. Students start with monitor programs, assemblers, and Pascal runtime preparation. This is the transition from hardware to software development.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Term 1, students will:
- Develop monitor programs for the 65C816 system
- Create or configure assemblers for 65C816
- Prepare Pascal runtime library
- Understand software development on custom hardware
- Begin high-level language development

## Week Structure

### Weeks 1-4: Monitor Program and Machine Code Monitor
- Develop basic monitor program
- Implement memory inspection/editing
- Implement register display
- Implement single-step execution
- Test monitor functionality

### Weeks 5-8: Assembler and Toolchain
- Configure or develop 65C816 assembler
- Set up cross-assembly toolchain
- Create assembly language programs
- Test assembler output
- Integrate with monitor

### Weeks 9-12: Pascal Runtime and Language Prep
- Understand Pascal runtime requirements
- Design runtime library interface
- Implement basic runtime functions
- Prepare for compiler integration
- Test runtime with simple programs

## Materials

### Components
- Complete 65C816 breadboard system (from Year 4)
- Serial interface for communication
- Development PC for cross-development

### Tools
- Text editor
- Cross-assembler (ca65 or similar)
- Serial terminal software
- SuperPascal compiler source (for reference)

## Assessment

- **Formative**: Weekly software development checkpoints
- **Summative**: Monitor program project (Weeks 1-4)
- **Summative**: Assembler and toolchain setup (Weeks 5-8)
- **Summative**: Pascal runtime preparation (Weeks 9-12)
- **Final**: Working software development environment

## Prerequisites

Students must have completed Year 4 and have:
- Working 65C816 hardware system
- Understanding of assembly language
- Basic programming concepts
- Understanding of system architecture

## Key Concepts

- **Monitor Programs**: Low-level system control
- **Assemblers**: Converting assembly to machine code
- **Runtime Libraries**: Supporting high-level languages
- **Cross-Development**: Developing on PC for target system
- **Software Stack**: Building layers of software

## Milestones

- **Week 4**: Monitor program working
- **Week 8**: Assembler and toolchain functional
- **Week 12**: Pascal runtime ready for compiler
