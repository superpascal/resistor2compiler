# Week 29-32: Advanced Pascal Programming - Theory

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week-block, students will:
- Use advanced Pascal features
- Create graphics programs
- Create sound programs
- Develop games
- Build complete applications

## Prerequisites

- PascalOS working
- SuperPascal compiler extended
- Understanding of graphics/sound hardware
- Experience with Pascal programming

## Key Concepts

### 1. Advanced Pascal Features

**Advanced Language Features**:
- Records and structures
- Pointers and dynamic memory
- Procedures and functions
- Units and modules
- Object-oriented concepts (if supported)

**Programming Techniques**:
- Data structures
- Algorithms
- Code organization
- Error handling

### 2. Graphics Programming

**Graphics Concepts**:
- Pixel manipulation
- Drawing primitives (lines, circles, rectangles)
- Sprites and bitmaps
- Animation
- Graphics libraries

**Implementation**:
- Use graphics hardware (if available)
- Or software rendering
- Graphics API design
- Performance optimization

### 3. Sound Programming

**Sound Concepts**:
- Sound generation
- Music composition
- Sound effects
- Audio playback
- Sound libraries

**Implementation**:
- Use sound hardware (if available)
- Or software synthesis
- Sound API design
- Timing and synchronization

### 4. Game Development

**Game Concepts**:
- Game loop
- Input handling
- Collision detection
- Game state management
- Game design

**Implementation**:
- Game architecture
- Graphics and sound integration
- User interaction
- Game logic

### 5. Application Development

**Application Types**:
- Utilities
- Tools
- Demos
- Applications
- Complete programs

**Development Process**:
- Requirements analysis
- Design
- Implementation
- Testing
- Documentation

## Implementation Approach

### Creating Advanced Programs

1. **Plan Program**:
   - Define requirements
   - Design architecture
   - Plan features

2. **Implement Core**:
   - Core functionality
   - Data structures
   - Algorithms

3. **Add Features**:
   - Graphics
   - Sound
   - User interface
   - Advanced features

4. **Test and Refine**:
   - Test functionality
   - Optimize performance
   - Fix bugs
   - Polish

## Connections to Previous Learning

- **PascalOS**: Programs use OS services
- **Compiler**: Advanced features require compiler support
- **Runtime**: Runtime provides low-level support
- **Hardware**: Programs use hardware capabilities

## Next Steps

After completing advanced programming, students will:
- Prepare A-Level project
- Document complete system
- Create project presentation
- Demonstrate system capabilities
