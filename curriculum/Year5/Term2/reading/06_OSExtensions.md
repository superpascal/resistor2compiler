# Chapter 6: Operating System Extensions

## Introduction

Operating system extensions complete the software stack. This chapter explains how to extend the monitor and create documentation.

## Operating System Concepts

**What is an OS?**
- Manages hardware resources
- Provides services to programs
- Handles I/O operations
- Manages memory
- Coordinates execution

**OS components**:
- Kernel (core functionality)
- File system
- Process management
- I/O management
- System calls

## Monitor Extensions

**Current monitor**:
- Basic commands
- Memory operations
- Program execution
- Serial I/O
- Limited functionality

**Extension goals**:
- File operations
- Program loading
- Directory listing
- Better command interface
- More services

**Extension methods**:
- Add new commands
- Extend existing commands
- Add file system support
- Improve interface
- Add features

## File System Support

**File system options**:
- FAT16/FAT32 (on SD card)
- Simple sequential
- Custom format
- Pre-existing library

**Simple approach**:
- Sequential sector reading
- Named file support
- Basic directory
- File loading
- Limited but functional

## Program Loading

**Loading methods**:
- From SD card
- From serial
- From ROM
- From memory

**SD card loading**:
- Read file from SD
- Load into memory
- Execute program
- Development workflow

## System Documentation

**Documentation types**:
- User manual
- Technical manual
- Programmer's guide
- Hardware documentation
- Project documentation

**User manual**:
- How to boot
- How to use monitor
- How to load programs
- How to compile
- Troubleshooting

**Technical manual**:
- System architecture
- Schematics
- Design decisions
- Memory map
- I/O map
- Future improvements

## Project Reflection

**Reflection topics**:
- Most challenging aspects
- Most rewarding aspects
- Key learnings
- Skills developed
- Future directions

**Journey summary**:
- From resistors to computer
- From logic gates to compiler
- From assembly to Pascal
- Complete understanding
- Achievement unlocked

## Practice Questions

1. What is an operating system?
2. How do we extend the monitor?
3. How do we implement file system?
4. What goes in documentation?
5. What have we learned?

## Key Takeaways

- OS manages system resources
- Extensions add functionality
- File system enables program loading
- Documentation preserves knowledge
- Reflection reinforces learning
