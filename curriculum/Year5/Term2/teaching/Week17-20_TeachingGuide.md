# Week 17-20: Pascal Program Development & Demos - Teaching Guide

## Overview

This teaching guide supports Pascal program development over 4 weeks. Students create graphics demos, sound demos, and games.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week-block, students will:
- Develop Pascal programs
- Create graphics demos
- Create sound demos
- Develop simple games
- Showcase programs

## Prerequisites Check

Before starting, ensure students:
- ✅ Completed Weeks 13-16 (Compiler)
- ✅ Have working compiler
- ✅ Understand Pascal
- ✅ Understand hardware interfaces

## Week-by-Week Breakdown

### Week 17: Basic Programs

**Theory Session (45 min)**:

- Debug issues
- Document programs

**Key Points**:
- Start simple
- Test on hardware
- Use runtime library
- Document code

**Common Questions**:
- Q: How to start? A: Simple I/O program
- Q: How to test? A: Compile, load, run
- Q: What if fails? A: Debug, check runtime

### Week 18: Graphics Programs

**Theory Session (45 min)**:
- Graphics programming
- Graphics library
- Coordinate systems
- Animation concepts

**Lab Session (90 min)**:
- Write graphics demos
- Test on hardware
- Create animations
- Optimize if needed

**Key Points**:
- Use graphics library
- Test on hardware
- Consider performance
- Create visual demos

**Common Questions**:
- Q: How to draw? A: Use PlotPixel, graphics functions
- Q: How to animate? A: Clear, draw, update, repeat
- Q: What if slow? A: Optimize, simplify

### Week 19: Sound and Games

**Theory Session (45 min)**:
- Sound programming
- Game development
- Game loops
- Real-time interaction

**Lab Session (90 min)**:
- Write sound demos

- Test on hardware
- Debug and fix

**Key Points**:
- Use sound library
- Design game loop
- Test thoroughly
- Create fun demos

**Common Questions**:
- Q: How to make sound? A: Use SOUND function
- Q: How to make game? A: Game loop, input, update, render
- Q: What if issues? A: Debug, test incrementally

### Week 20: Program Showcase

**Theory Session (45 min)**:
- Showcase preparation
- Presentation skills
- Documentation
- Reflection

**Lab Session (90 min)**:
- Finalize programs
- Prepare presentations
- Practice demonstrations
- Present to class

**Key Points**:
- Prepare thoroughly
- Test before showcase
- Present clearly
- Celebrate achievement

**Common Questions**:
- Q: How to present? A: Run on hardware, explain, show code
- Q: What to include? A: Demo, explanation, code
- Q: What if fails? A: Have backup, test beforehand

## Teaching Strategies

### Differentiation

**Support for struggling students**:
- Provide program templates
- Step-by-step guides
- Extra time for work
- Pair with stronger students
- Review concepts

**Extension for advanced students**:
- Advanced graphics
- Complex games
- Help other students

### Common Misconceptions

1. **"Pascal is limited"**
   - Clarify: Powerful for this system
   - Show capabilities

2. **"Games are too complex"**
   - Clarify: Start simple
   - Show progression

3. **"Graphics is hard"**
   - Clarify: Use library functions
   - Show examples

### Assessment Checkpoints

**Week 17**: Are basic programs working?
**Week 18**: Are graphics demos working?
**Week 19**: Are sound/games working?
**Week 20**: Is showcase successful?

## Resources

- Program templates
- Graphics library docs
- Sound library docs
- Game examples

## Next Week

After completing programs, students extend OS (Week 21-24).
