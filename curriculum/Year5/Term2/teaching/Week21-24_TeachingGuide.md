# Week 21-24: Operating System/Monitor Extensions - Teaching Guide

## Overview

This teaching guide supports OS extensions and documentation over 4 weeks. Students extend the monitor, implement file system, and create documentation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week-block, students will:
- Extend monitor functionality
- Implement file system support
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Reflect on complete journey
- Complete the six-year curriculum

## Prerequisites Check

Before starting, ensure students:
- ✅ Completed Weeks 17-20 (Pascal Programs)
- ✅ Have working programs
- ✅ Understand OS concepts
- ✅ Ready for final work

## Week-by-Week Breakdown

### Week 21: Monitor Extensions

**Theory Session (45 min)**:

- Test extensions

**Key Points**:
- Extend incrementally
- Test thoroughly
- Document changes
- Improve interface

**Common Questions**:
- Q: What to extend? A: File operations, program loading
- Q: How complex? A: Start simple, add features
- Q: What if unclear? A: Review monitor code

### Week 22: File System Support

**Theory Session (45 min)**:
- File system concepts
- FAT file system
- SD card interface
- Implementation approaches

**Lab Session (90 min)**:
- Choose approach
- Implement file reading
- Test file operations
- Integrate with monitor

**Key Points**:
- Use library or simple approach
- Test file operations
- Integrate carefully
- Document implementation

**Common Questions**:
- Q: Which file system? A: FAT or simple sequential
- Q: How complex? A: Use library if possible
- Q: What if fails? A: Debug, check SD interface

### Week 23: Documentation Creation

**Theory Session (45 min)**:
- Documentation types
- Documentation structure
- Writing guidelines
- Technical writing

**Lab Session (90 min)**:
- Plan documentation
- Write user manual
- Write technical manual
- Create diagrams
- Review documentation

**Key Points**:
- Complete documentation
- Clear and organized
- Include examples
- Review thoroughly

**Common Questions**:
- Q: What to include? A: User guide, technical docs, schematics
- Q: How detailed? A: Complete but clear
- Q: What if unclear? A: Review examples, clarify

### Week 24: Final System and Reflection

**Theory Session (45 min)**:
- System completion
- Reflection process
- Future possibilities
- Celebration

**Lab Session (90 min)**:
- Finalize system
- Complete documentation
- Write reflection
- Present complete system
- Celebrate achievement

**Key Points**:
- Complete everything
- Reflect on journey
- Celebrate achievement
- Prepare for future

**Common Questions**:
- Q: What to reflect on? A: Challenges, rewards, learnings
- Q: What next? A: Extend system, help others, continue learning
- Q: How to celebrate? A: Present system, share achievement

## Teaching Strategies

### Differentiation

**Support for struggling students**:
- Provide documentation templates
- Step-by-step guides
- Extra time for work
- Pair with stronger students
- Review concepts

**Extension for advanced students**:
- Advanced OS features
- Multitasking implementation
- Help other students

### Common Misconceptions

1. **"OS is too complex"**
   - Clarify: Start simple
   - Show basic implementation

2. **"File system is hard"**
   - Clarify: Use library or simple approach
   - Show basic implementation

3. **"Documentation is optional"**
   - Clarify: Essential for future
   - Show importance

### Assessment Checkpoints

**Week 21**: Are monitor extensions working?
**Week 22**: Is file system working?
**Week 23**: Is documentation complete?
**Week 24**: Is system complete?

## Resources

- OS design guides
- File system libraries
- Documentation templates
- Reflection guides

## Completion

After completing OS extensions and documentation, students have completed the six-year curriculum!
