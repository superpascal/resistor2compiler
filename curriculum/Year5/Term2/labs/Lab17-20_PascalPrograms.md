- Create graphics demos
- Create sound demos
- Develop simple games
- Showcase programs

## Prerequisites

- Completed Lab 13-16 (Compiler)
- Working SuperPascal compiler
- Understanding of Pascal
- Understanding of hardware

## Materials

### Components
- Complete PCB system
- Development PC
- SD card for programs

### Tools
- Text editor
- Compiler
- Serial terminal
- Graphics/sound hardware

## Safety

- Software development activity
- Test programs carefully
- Monitor system operation

## Lab Sessions

### Session 1: Basic Programs (Week 17)

**Objective**: Develop basic Pascal programs

**Steps**:
1. Write simple I/O program
2. Write arithmetic program
3. Write control flow program
4. Compile and test
5. Verify on hardware
6. Debug if needed
7. Document programs

**Expected Result**: Basic programs working

**Troubleshooting**:
- If programs fail: Debug, check runtime
- If unclear: Review examples
- If issues: Test incrementally

### Session 2: Graphics Programs (Week 18)

**Objective**: Develop graphics demos

**Steps**:
1. Write graphics library (or use existing)
2. Create graphics demo
3. Test on hardware
4. Create animations
5. Test performance
6. Optimize if needed
7. Document demos

**Expected Result**: Graphics demos working

**Troubleshooting**:
- If graphics fails: Check initialization, check hardware
- If performance issues: Optimize, simplify
- If issues: Debug systematically

### Session 3: Sound and Game Programs (Week 19)

**Objective**: Develop sound demos and games

**Steps**:
1. Write sound demo
2. Test sound output
3. Write simple game
4. Test game logic
5. Test on hardware
6. Debug and fix
7. Document programs

**Expected Result**: Sound demos and games working

**Troubleshooting**:
- If sound fails: Check initialization, check hardware
- If game issues: Debug logic, test incrementally
- If issues: Address systematically

### Session 4: Program Showcase (Week 20)

**Objective**: Prepare and present program showcase

**Steps**:
1. Finalize all programs
2. Test thoroughly
3. Prepare presentations
4. Document programs
5. Practice demonstrations
6. Present to class
7. Reflect on work

**Expected Result**: Successful program showcase

**Troubleshooting**:
- If showcase issues: Test beforehand, have backups
- If presentation unclear: Practice, prepare notes
- If issues: Address before showcase

## Assessment

### Practical Assessment
- Successfully develop programs
- Create graphics demos
- Create sound demos
- Develop games
- Present showcase

### Lab Report
Students should document:
- Program descriptions
- Source code
- Test results
- Showcase presentation
- Reflection on programs

## Extension Activities

- Advanced graphics
- Complex games
- Music composition
- Help other students

## Next Lab

After completing programs, students will extend OS (Lab 21-24).
