# Lab 21-24: Operating System/Monitor Extensions

## Lab Overview

In this lab, students will extend the monitor/OS functionality, implement file system support, and create comprehensive documentation.

## Learning Objectives

- Extend monitor functionality
- Implement file system support
- Add program loading
- Create documentation
- Reflect on journey

## Prerequisites

- Completed Lab 17-20 (Pascal Programs)
- Working programs
- Understanding of OS concepts

## Materials

### Components
- Complete PCB system
- SD card with files
- Development PC

### Tools
- Text editor
- Documentation tools
- Serial terminal

## Safety

- Software development activity
- Test extensions carefully
- Document thoroughly

## Lab Sessions

### Session 1: Monitor Extensions (Week 21)

**Objective**: Extend monitor with new commands

**Steps**:
1. Review current monitor
2. Design new commands
3. Implement commands
4. Test commands
5. Integrate with monitor
6. Test complete system
7. Document extensions

**Expected Result**: Extended monitor working

**Troubleshooting**:
- If commands fail: Debug, check implementation
- If unclear: Review monitor code
- If issues: Test incrementally

### Session 2: File System Support (Week 22)

**Objective**: Implement file system support

**Steps**:
1. Choose file system approach
2. Implement file reading
3. Implement directory listing
4. Test file operations
5. Integrate with monitor
6. Test program loading
7. Document file system

**Expected Result**: File system working

**Troubleshooting**:
- If file system fails: Debug, check SD interface
- If unclear: Use library or simple approach
- If issues: Test incrementally

### Session 3: Documentation Creation (Week 23)

**Objective**: Create comprehensive documentation

**Steps**:
1. Plan documentation structure
2. Write user manual
3. Write technical manual
4. Document programs
5. Create schematics
6. Add diagrams
7. Review documentation

**Expected Result**: Complete documentation

**Troubleshooting**:
- If documentation unclear: Review examples, clarify
- If incomplete: Add missing sections
- If issues: Organize, review

### Session 4: Final System and Reflection (Week 24)

**Objective**: Complete system and reflect

**Steps**:
1. Finalize all extensions
2. Test complete system
3. Verify documentation
4. Write reflection
5. Prepare final presentation
6. Present complete system
7. Celebrate achievement

**Expected Result**: Complete system with documentation

**Troubleshooting**:
- If system issues: Debug, fix, verify
- If documentation incomplete: Complete all sections
- If issues: Address systematically

## Assessment

### Practical Assessment
- Successfully extend monitor
- Implement file system
- Create documentation
- Complete system
- Reflect on journey

### Lab Report
Students should document:
- Monitor extensions
- File system implementation
- Documentation
- System verification
- Reflection on journey

## Extension Activities
