# Year 5, Term 2: High-Level Language & OS

## Overview

Term 2 of Year 5 focuses on software stack development. Students implement the SuperPascal compiler, develop Pascal programs, and extend the operating system/monitor.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Term 2, students will:
- Understand compiler structure and operation
- Configure SuperPascal compiler for 65C816
- Extend compiler with new features
- Develop Pascal programs for the system
- Extend monitor/OS functionality
- Document the complete system

## Week Structure

### Weeks 13-16: SuperPascal Compiler Implementation
- Understand compiler structure
- Configure compiler for 65C816
- Extend compiler with intrinsics
- Test compiler with sample programs
- Verify code generation

### Weeks 17-20: Pascal Program Development & Demos
- Develop Pascal programs
- Create graphics demos
- Create sound demos
- Develop simple games
- Showcase programs

### Weeks 21-24: Operating System/Monitor Extensions
- Extend monitor functionality
- Implement file system (basic)
- Add program loading from SD
- Create system documentation
- Final project reflection

## Materials

### Components
- Complete 65C816 breadboard system (from Year 4)
- Serial interface for communication
- Development PC for cross-compilation

### Tools
- SuperPascal compiler source
- Cross-assembler
- Text editor
- Serial terminal
- Documentation tools

## Assessment

- **Formative**: Weekly compiler/program reviews
- **Summative**: Compiler extension project (Weeks 13-16)
- **Summative**: Pascal program demos (Weeks 17-20)
- **Summative**: OS extensions and documentation (Weeks 21-24)
- **Final**: Complete system demonstration with Pascal programs

## Prerequisites

Students must have completed Term 1 and have:
- Working 65C816 breadboard system
- Monitor program and toolchain working
- Pascal runtime library ready
- Understanding of assembly language
- Basic programming concepts
- Understanding of compilers (conceptual)

## Key Concepts

- **Compiler Structure**: Front-end, back-end, code generation
- **Pascal Programming**: High-level language on custom hardware
- **Runtime Library**: Low-level support routines
- **OS Extensions**: Monitor enhancements
- **System Documentation**: Complete project documentation

## Milestones

- **Week 16**: Compiler working and extended
- **Week 20**: Pascal programs running on system
- **Week 24**: Complete system documented
