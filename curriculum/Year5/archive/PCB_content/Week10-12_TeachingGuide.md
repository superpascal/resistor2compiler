# Week 10-12: System Integration on PCB - Teaching Guide

## Overview

This teaching guide supports system integration over 3 weeks. Students integrate all boards and verify complete system.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week-block, students will:
- Integrate all boards
- Test complete system
- Verify video and audio
- Test SD card interface
- Complete acceptance testing

## Prerequisites Check

Before starting, ensure students:
- ✅ Completed Weeks 6-9 (Assembly)
- ✅ All boards tested
- ✅ Understand integration
- ✅ Understand testing

## Week-by-Week Breakdown

### Week 10: Board Integration

**Theory Session (45 min)**:
- Integration process
- Connection methods
- Verification procedures
- Safety precautions

**Lab Session (90 min)**:
- Mount boards
- Connect boards
- Verify connections
- Secure mounting
- Prepare for power-up

**Key Points**:
- Verify connections
- Secure mounting
- Check alignment
- Safety first

**Common Questions**:
- Q: How to connect? A: Follow design, verify
- Q: What if unclear? A: Review design, check
- Q: Ready to power? A: Yes, if verified

### Week 11: Initial System Testing

**Theory Session (45 min)**:
- Boot procedures
- Memory testing
- Interrupt testing
- Debugging approaches

**Lab Session (90 min)**:
- Power up system
- Test boot sequence
- Test monitor
- Test memory
- Test interrupts

**Key Points**:
- Test systematically
- Monitor boot
- Verify operation
- Document results

**Common Questions**:
- Q: What if doesn't boot? A: Debug reset, clock, ROM
- Q: How to test? A: Systematic, one subsystem at a time
- Q: What if issues? A: Debug, fix, retest

### Week 12: Complete System Verification

**Theory Session (45 min)**:
- Acceptance testing
- Performance testing
- Stress testing
- Documentation

**Lab Session (90 min)**:
- Test video
- Test audio
- Test SD card
- Run acceptance tests
- Document system

**Key Points**:
- Test all features
- Verify performance
- Document completely
- Ready for software

**Common Questions**:
- Q: How to verify? A: Run all tests, check results
- Q: What if fails? A: Debug, fix, retest
- Q: Ready for Term 2? A: Yes, if all working

## Teaching Strategies

### Differentiation

**Support for struggling students**:
- Provide integration checklists
- Step-by-step guides
- Extra time for work
- Pair with stronger students
- Review procedures

**Extension for advanced students**:
- Performance optimization
- Advanced features
- Help other students

### Common Misconceptions

1. **"Integration is easy"**
   - Clarify: Requires careful testing
   - Show complexity

2. **"Everything will work"**
   - Clarify: Issues expected
   - Show debugging needed

3. **"Can skip tests"**
   - Clarify: Essential for reliability
   - Show importance

### Assessment Checkpoints

**Week 10**: Are boards integrated?
**Week 11**: Does system boot?
**Week 12**: Is system complete?

## Resources

- Integration guides
- Testing procedures
- Debugging guides
- Acceptance test checklists

## Next Term

After completing integration, students develop software stack (Term 2).
