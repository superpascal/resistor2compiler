# Week 6-9: PCB Assembly and Unit Testing - Teaching Guide

## Overview

This teaching guide supports PCB assembly and testing over 4 weeks. Students assemble components and verify each board.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week-block, students will:
- Assemble components on PCBs
- Perform continuity and smoke tests
- Test each subsystem
- Document assembly and testing
- Verify boards before integration

## Prerequisites Check

Before starting, ensure students:
- ✅ Completed Weeks 1-5 (PCB Design)
- ✅ Received PCBs
- ✅ Understand soldering
- ✅ Understand ESD protection

## Week-by-Week Breakdown

### Week 6: PCB Inspection and Preparation

**Theory Session (45 min)**:

- Review assembly order

**Key Points**:
- Inspect carefully
- ESD protection essential
- Organize before starting
- Safety first

**Common Questions**:
- Q: What to check? A: Defects, dimensions, holes
- Q: ESD important? A: Yes, can destroy chips
- Q: How to organize? A: By assembly order

### Week 7: Component Assembly

**Theory Session (45 min)**:
- Soldering techniques
- Component orientation
- Assembly order
- Quality control

**Lab Session (90 min)**:
- Solder components
- Install sockets
- Install connectors

- Power up without chips
- Verify voltages
- Document results

**Key Points**:
- Test before chips
- Verify voltages
- Check for shorts
- Document everything

**Common Questions**:
- Q: Why test first? A: Protect chips from damage
- Q: What voltages? A: 5.0V ± 0.1V
- Q: What if wrong? A: Debug, fix, retest

### Week 9: Subsystem Testing

**Theory Session (45 min)**:
- Testing procedures
- Subsystem verification
- Documentation
- Issue resolution

**Lab Session (90 min)**:
- Test reset circuit
- Test clock circuit
- Test memory
- Test I/O
- Document all tests

**Key Points**:
- Test each subsystem
- Document results
- Fix issues
- Verify before integration

**Common Questions**:
- Q: How to test? A: Systematic, one at a time
- Q: What if fails? A: Debug, fix, retest
- Q: Ready for integration? A: Yes, if all tested

## Teaching Strategies

### Differentiation

**Support for struggling students**:
- Provide assembly checklists
- Step-by-step guides
- Extra time for work
- Pair with stronger students
- Review techniques

**Extension for advanced students**:
- Advanced testing techniques
- Performance optimization
- Help other students

### Common Misconceptions

1. **"Assembly is easy"**
   - Clarify: Requires care and skill
   - Show importance

2. **"Can skip testing"**
   - Clarify: Essential for success
   - Show consequences

3. **"ESD not important"**
   - Clarify: Can destroy chips
   - Show protection needed

### Assessment Checkpoints

**Week 6**: Are PCBs inspected?
**Week 7**: Are components assembled?
**Week 8**: Do boards pass tests?
**Week 9**: Are subsystems tested?

## Resources

- Assembly guides
- Soldering tutorials
- Testing procedures
- ESD protection guides

## Next Week

After completing assembly and testing, students integrate system (Week 10-12).
