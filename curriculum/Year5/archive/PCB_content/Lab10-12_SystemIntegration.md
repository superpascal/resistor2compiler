# Lab 10-12: System Integration on PCB

## Lab Overview

In this lab, students will integrate all PCB boards into a complete system and perform comprehensive testing.

## Learning Objectives

- Integrate all boards
- Test complete system
- Verify video and audio
- Test SD card interface
- Complete acceptance testing

## Prerequisites

- Completed Lab 6-9 (PCB Assembly)
- All boards assembled and tested
- Understanding of system integration

## Materials

### Components
- All assembled boards
- Connectors and cables
- Power supply
- Test equipment

### Tools
- Logic analyzer
- Oscilloscope
- Serial terminal
- Test programs

## Safety

- Verify connections before power
- Monitor for overheating
- Check for shorts
- Proper power sequencing

## Lab Sessions

### Session 1: Board Integration (Week 10)

**Objective**: Connect all boards

**Steps**:
1. Mount boards
2. Connect boards
3. Verify connections
4. Check alignment
5. Secure mounting
6. Verify power distribution
7. Prepare for power-up

**Expected Result**: All boards connected

**Troubleshooting**:
- If connections unclear: Review design
- If alignment issues: Adjust, verify
- If problems: Check connections

### Session 2: Initial System Testing (Week 11)

**Objective**: Test basic system operation

**Steps**:
1. Power up system
2. Monitor boot sequence
3. Test monitor program
4. Test memory
5. Test interrupts
6. Test basic I/O
7. Document results

**Expected Result**: Basic system working

**Troubleshooting**:
- If boot fails: Debug reset, clock, ROM
- If memory fails: Check connections, test individually
- If issues: Debug systematically

### Session 3: Complete System Verification (Week 12)

**Objective**: Verify all functionality

**Steps**:
1. Test video output
2. Test audio output
3. Test SD card interface
4. Run acceptance tests
5. Performance testing
6. Stress testing
7. Document complete system

**Expected Result**: Complete system verified and working

**Troubleshooting**:
- If video fails: Check initialization, check connections
- If audio fails: Check chip, check connections
- If issues: Debug, fix, retest

## Assessment

### Practical Assessment
- Successfully integrate system
- Test all functionality
- Verify video/audio
- Pass acceptance tests
- Document system

### Lab Report
Students should document:
- Integration process
- Test procedures
- Test results
- Issues and fixes
- System verification

## Extension Activities

- Performance optimization
- Advanced features
- System enhancements
- Help other students

## Next Term

After completing integration, students will develop software stack (Term 2).
