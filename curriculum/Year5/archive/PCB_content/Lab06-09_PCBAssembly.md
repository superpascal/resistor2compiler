# Lab 6-9: PCB Assembly and Unit Testing

## Lab Overview

In this lab, students will assemble components on PCBs, perform testing, and verify each board before integration.

## Learning Objectives

- Assemble components on PCBs
- Perform continuity and smoke tests
- Test each subsystem
- Document assembly and testing
- Verify boards before integration

## Prerequisites

- Completed Lab 1-5 (PCB Design)
- Received fabricated PCBs
- Understanding of soldering
- Understanding of ESD protection

## Materials

### Components
- All components for PCBs
- Solder and flux
- Sockets for ICs

### Tools
- Soldering equipment
- Multimeter
- Oscilloscope
- Logic analyzer
- ESD protection equipment

## Safety

- ESD protection mandatory
- Proper soldering technique
- Ventilation for soldering
- Careful handling of chips

## Lab Sessions

### Session 1: PCB Inspection and Preparation (Week 6)

**Objective**: Inspect PCBs and prepare for assembly

**Steps**:
1. Inspect received PCBs
2. Check for defects
3. Verify dimensions
4. Prepare work area
5. Set up ESD protection
6. Organize components
7. Review assembly order

**Expected Result**: PCBs inspected and ready

**Troubleshooting**:
- If defects found: Contact fabrication house
- If unclear: Review design files
- If issues: Document and address

### Session 2: Component Assembly (Week 7)

**Objective**: Solder components to PCBs

**Steps**:
1. Solder power components first
2. Solder passive components
3. Install IC sockets
4. Install connectors
5. Install ICs (carefully)
6. Inspect solder joints
7. Clean boards

**Expected Result**: All components assembled

**Troubleshooting**:
- If soldering issues: Practice, improve technique
- If component issues: Check orientation, verify parts
- If problems: Review, fix, retest

### Session 3: Continuity and Smoke Tests (Week 8)

**Objective**: Perform initial testing

**Steps**:
1. Perform continuity tests
2. Check for shorts
3. Verify connections
4. Power up without chips
5. Check regulator output
6. Verify voltages
7. Document results

**Expected Result**: Boards pass initial tests

**Troubleshooting**:
- If shorts found: Locate and fix
- If voltage wrong: Check regulator, check connections
- If issues: Debug systematically

### Session 4: Subsystem Testing (Week 9)

**Objective**: Test each subsystem

**Steps**:
1. Test reset circuit
2. Test clock circuit
3. Test address decoding
4. Test memory
5. Test I/O
6. Document all tests
7. Verify each subsystem

**Expected Result**: All subsystems tested and working

**Troubleshooting**:
- If tests fail: Debug, fix, retest
- If unclear: Review test procedures
- If issues: Document and address

## Assessment

### Practical Assessment
- Successfully assemble PCBs
- Pass continuity tests
- Pass smoke tests
- Test all subsystems
- Document results

### Lab Report
Students should document:
- Assembly process
- Test procedures
- Test results
- Issues encountered
- Fixes applied

## Extension Activities

- Advanced testing techniques
- Performance optimization
- Help other students

## Next Lab

After completing assembly and testing, students will integrate system (Lab 10-12).
