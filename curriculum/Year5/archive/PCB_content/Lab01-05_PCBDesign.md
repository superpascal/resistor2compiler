# Lab 1-5: Finalizing PCB Schematics and Layout

## Lab Overview

In this lab, students will finalize PCB schematics, create professional layouts, and prepare Gerber files for fabrication.

## Learning Objectives

- Finalize schematics for all boards
- Design power distribution
- Design reset and clock circuits
- Create PCB layouts
- Generate Gerber files

## Prerequisites

- Completed Year 4 (65C816 Prototype)
- Working breadboard prototype
- Complete system design
- Experience with KiCad

## Materials

### Components
- Complete component list
- Connector specifications
- Power supply components

### Tools
- KiCad (or similar)
- Computer for design
- Reference materials

## Safety

- Design activity (no hardware yet)
- Work carefully on designs
- Verify before ordering

## Lab Sessions

### Session 1: Schematic Finalization (Week 1)

**Objective**: Finalize all schematics

**Steps**:
1. Review breadboard design
2. Finalize main CPU board schematic
3. Finalize peripheral board schematics
4. Add power distribution
5. Add decoupling capacitors
6. Add connectors
7. Review schematics

**Expected Result**: Complete schematics ready

**Troubleshooting**:
- If schematics incomplete: Add missing components
- If errors found: Fix, review again
- If unclear: Use breadboard as reference

### Session 2: Power and Reset Design (Week 2)

**Objective**: Design power and reset circuits

**Steps**:
1. Design power supply circuit
2. Design voltage regulator
3. Design reset circuit
4. Add power distribution
5. Add decoupling strategy
6. Verify design
7. Document power requirements

**Expected Result**: Power and reset circuits designed

**Troubleshooting**:
- If power insufficient: Increase capacity
- If reset unclear: Review requirements
- If issues: Consult datasheets

### Session 3: Component Placement (Week 3)

**Objective**: Plan component placement

**Steps**:
1. Import schematics to layout
2. Plan component placement
3. Group related components
4. Consider routing
5. Consider heat
6. Plan test points
7. Document placement

**Expected Result**: Component placement planned

**Troubleshooting**:
- If placement unclear: Review best practices
- If conflicts: Adjust placement
- If issues: Consult layout guides

### Session 4: PCB Routing (Week 4)

**Objective**: Route PCB traces

**Steps**:
1. Route power and ground
2. Route critical signals
3. Route data bus
4. Route address bus
5. Route control signals
6. Add ground planes
7. Review routing

**Expected Result**: Complete PCB routing

**Troubleshooting**:
- If routing difficult: Adjust placement
- If conflicts: Reroute
- If issues: Review design rules

### Session 5: Gerber Generation and Review (Week 5)

**Objective**: Generate Gerber files and review

**Steps**:
1. Generate Gerber files
2. Verify all layers
3. Check drill files
4. Review with team
5. Peer review
6. Finalize design
7. Prepare for ordering

**Expected Result**: Gerber files ready for ordering

**Troubleshooting**:
- If Gerber errors: Fix, regenerate
- If review issues: Address feedback
- If unclear: Consult fabrication house

## Assessment

### Practical Assessment
- Successfully finalize schematics
- Design power and reset
- Create PCB layout
- Generate Gerber files
- Pass design review

### Lab Report
Students should document:
- Schematic decisions
- Power design
- Layout rationale
- Routing strategy
- Gerber file verification

## Extension Activities

- Advanced layout techniques
- Multi-layer design
- Signal integrity optimization
- Help other students

## Next Lab

After completing PCB design, students will wait for boards, then assemble (Lab 6-9).
