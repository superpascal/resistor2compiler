# Lab 1-3: Review and SAP-1 Improvements

## Lab Overview

In this lab, students will review their SAP-1 systems, identify issues, and implement reliability improvements.

## Learning Objectives

- Review SAP-1 operation comprehensively
- Identify reliability issues
- Implement signal integrity improvements
- Add decoupling capacitors
- Improve timing and stability
- Document all improvements

## Prerequisites

- Completed Year 3 (working SAP-1)
- Understanding of CPU operation
- Experience with debugging
- Understanding of signal integrity

## Materials

### Components
- Complete SAP-1 system
- Decoupling capacitors (0.1µF ceramic)
- Additional components for improvements
- Clock halt circuit components (if needed)

### Tools
- Oscilloscope (highly recommended)
- Logic analyzer
- Multimeter
- Documentation materials

## Safety

- Work with powered system carefully
- Verify improvements don't break system
- Test after each change

## Lab Sessions

### Session 1: System Review (Week 1)

**Objective**: Comprehensive SAP-1 review

**Steps**:
1. Run existing programs
2. Test all instructions
3. Identify any issues
4. Document current behavior
5. List reliability problems
6. Plan improvements
7. Create improvement log

**Expected Result**: Complete review with identified issues

**Troubleshooting**:
- If system doesn't work: Debug before improving
- If issues unclear: Test systematically
- If many issues: Prioritize most critical

### Session 2: Signal Integrity (Week 2)

**Objective**: Improve signal integrity

**Steps**:
1. Identify signal integrity issues
2. Add decoupling capacitors (0.1µF per IC)
3. Improve grounding
4. Shorten signal paths where possible
5. Test improvements
6. Verify signal quality (scope)
7. Document changes

**Expected Result**: Improved signal integrity, fewer glitches

**Troubleshooting**:
- If no improvement: Check capacitor placement, check grounding
- If worse: Revert, try different approach
- If new issues: Check connections, verify changes

### Session 3: Timing and Clock Improvements (Week 3)

**Objective**: Improve timing and clock stability

**Steps**:
1. Analyze timing issues
2. Improve clock circuit
3. Add clock halt circuit (if needed)
4. Improve signal synchronization
5. Test timing improvements
6. Verify system stability
7. Document changes

**Expected Result**: Better timing, more stable operation

**Troubleshooting**:
- If timing worse: Revert, check clock circuit
- If clock issues: Check oscillator, check distribution
- If stability issues: Check all timing, verify signals

### Session 4: Final Improvements and Documentation (Week 4)

**Objective**: Complete improvements and document

**Steps**:
1. Complete remaining improvements
2. Test all improvements together
3. Verify system reliability
4. Test with multiple programs
5. Document all improvements
6. Create improvement log
7. Prepare for instruction expansion

**Expected Result**: Improved, reliable SAP-1 system

**Troubleshooting**:
- If improvements conflict: Test individually, combine carefully
- If system breaks: Revert problematic changes
- If documentation incomplete: Complete all sections

## Assessment

### Practical Assessment
- Successfully review system
- Identify issues correctly
- Implement improvements
- Test improvements
- Document all changes

### Lab Report
Students should document:
- System review findings
- Issues identified
- Improvements made
- Test results before/after
- Improvement log
- Reflection on improvements

## Extension Activities

- Advanced signal integrity techniques
- Performance optimization
- Additional reliability features
- Help other students improve systems

## Next Lab

After completing improvements, students will move to expanded instruction set (Lab 5-8).
