# Year 4, Term 1: SAP-1 Enhancements

## Overview

Term 1 of Year 4 focuses on improving and enhancing the SAP-1 computer built in Year 3. Students learn to modify existing designs, expand capabilities, and prepare for more advanced systems.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Term 1, students will:
- Review and improve SAP-1 reliability
- Expand the instruction set with new instructions
- Expand memory from 4-bit to 8-bit addressing (16 to 256 bytes)
- Understand Harvard architecture concepts
- Implement memory expansion and address decoding

## Week Structure (Compressed: 12 weeks → 9 weeks)

**Note**: All content preserved, delivery compressed for efficiency.

### Weeks 1-3: Review and SAP-1 Improvements (Compressed from 4 weeks)
- Review SAP-1 operation and identify issues
- Implement reliability improvements
- Fix signal integrity issues
- Add decoupling and timing improvements
- Document improvements

### Weeks 4-6: Expanded Instruction Set (Compressed from 4 weeks)
- Design new instructions (LDB, ADI, etc.)
- Expand microcode ROM capacity
- Program new microcode sequences
- Test new instructions
