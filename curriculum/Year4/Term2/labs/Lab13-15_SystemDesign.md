# Lab 13-15: 65C816 System Design

## Lab Overview

In this lab, students will design a complete 65C816-based computer system, create schematics using CAD tools, and prepare for prototype construction.

## Learning Objectives

- Design 65C816 system architecture
- Plan memory map and address decoding
- Design I/O interfaces
- Create schematics in KiCad
- Review and refine design

## Prerequisites

- Completed Lab 13-16 (65C816 Introduction)
- Understanding of 65C816 architecture
- Understanding of system design
- Understanding of address decoding

## Materials

### Components
- Schematic capture software (KiCad)
- 65C816 datasheet
- Component datasheets
- Design templates

### Tools
- Computer with KiCad
- Reference materials
- Design checklists

## Safety

- Design activity (no hardware yet)
- Work carefully on schematics
- Verify design before building

## Lab Sessions

### Session 1: System Architecture Design (Week 17)

**Objective**: Design system architecture

**Steps**:
1. Define system requirements
2. List required components
3. Plan system architecture
4. Design memory map
5. Design I/O map
6. Plan address decoding
7. Document architecture

**Expected Result**: Complete system architecture design

**Troubleshooting**:
- If design unclear: Simplify, focus on essentials
- If components missing: Research, add to design
- If architecture wrong: Review, revise

### Session 2: Memory Map and Address Decoding (Week 18)

**Objective**: Design memory map and address decoding

**Steps**:
1. Design detailed memory map
2. Plan RAM organization
3. Plan ROM organization
4. Plan I/O space
5. Design address decoding logic
6. Create decoding table
7. Document memory map

**Expected Result**: Complete memory map and decoding design

**Troubleshooting**:
- If map unclear: Use examples, simplify
- If decoding complex: Break into parts
- If conflicts: Review, adjust map

### Session 3: Schematic Creation (Week 19)

**Objective**: Create schematics in KiCad

**Steps**:
1. Set up KiCad project
2. Add components to schematic
3. Connect components
4. Add power and ground
5. Add decoupling capacitors
6. Label all components
7. Add title block
8. Review schematic

**Expected Result**: Complete schematic in KiCad

**Troubleshooting**:
- If KiCad issues: Use tutorials, ask for help
- If connections wrong: Review design, check datasheets
- If incomplete: Add missing components

### Session 4: Design Review and Refinement (Week 20)

**Objective**: Review and refine design

**Steps**:
1. Review schematic for errors
2. Check address decoding
3. Verify power distribution
4. Check component compatibility
5. Peer review design
6. Incorporate feedback
7. Finalize design
8. Prepare for construction

**Expected Result**: Reviewed and refined design ready for construction

**Troubleshooting**:
- If errors found: Fix, review again
- If feedback unclear: Ask questions, clarify
- If design incomplete: Complete all sections

## Assessment

### Practical Assessment
- Successfully design system architecture
- Create memory map and decoding
- Create complete schematic
- Review and refine design
- Document design process

### Lab Report
Students should document:
- System architecture
- Memory map design
- Address decoding logic
- Schematic (print or export)
- Design decisions
- Review feedback

## Extension Activities

- Advanced system features
- Optimize design
- Add expansion capabilities
- Help other students

## Next Lab

After completing system design, students will move to breadboard prototype construction (Lab 21-24).
