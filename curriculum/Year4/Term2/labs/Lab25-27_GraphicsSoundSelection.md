- Prototype selected solutions
- Evaluate trade-offs
- Prepare proposals for Year 6

## Prerequisites

- Completed Lab 5-8 (I/O Subsystems)
- Complete I/O integration
- Understanding of system design
- Research skills

## Materials

### Components
- Video research components (varies by option)
- Audio research components (varies by option)
- Prototyping materials
- Test equipment

### Tools
- Research materials
- Datasheets
- Computer for research
- Prototyping tools

## Safety

## Lab Sessions

### Session 1: Video Research (Week 9)

**Objective**: Research video output options

**Steps**:
1. Research TMS9918/V9958 VDP
2. Research FPGA solutions (VERA)
3. Research microcontroller solutions
4. Research discrete logic
5. Compare features
6. Evaluate trade-offs
7. Document research

**Expected Result**: Complete video research

**Troubleshooting**:
- If research unclear: Use multiple sources, ask questions
- If options unclear: Focus on buildable options
- If trade-offs unclear: Create comparison table

### Session 2: Audio Research (Week 10)

**Objective**: Research audio output options

**Steps**:
1. Research YM2149F PSG
2. Research SAM2695 MIDI
3. Research microcontroller PWM
4. Research simple solutions
5. Compare features
6. Evaluate trade-offs
7. Document research

**Expected Result**: Complete audio research

**Troubleshooting**:
- If research unclear: Use multiple sources, ask questions
- If options unclear: Focus on buildable options
- If trade-offs unclear: Create comparison table

### Session 3: Prototyping (Week 11)

**Objective**: Prototype selected solutions

**Steps**:
1. Select video solution to prototype
2. Select audio solution to prototype
3. Build video prototype
4. Build audio prototype
5. Test prototypes
6. Evaluate feasibility
7. Document results

**Expected Result**: Working prototypes

**Troubleshooting**:
- If prototype fails: Simplify, test components
- If too complex: Choose simpler option
- If issues: Debug, document problems

### Session 4: Proposal Development (Week 12)

**Objective**: Develop proposals for Year 6

**Steps**:
1. Finalize video selection
2. Finalize audio selection
3. Create implementation plan
4. List required parts
5. Estimate costs
6. Create timeline
7. Present proposals

**Expected Result**: Complete proposals ready for Year 6

**Troubleshooting**:
- If proposals incomplete: Add missing sections
- If costs unclear: Research prices, estimate
- If timeline unclear: Break into steps

## Assessment

### Practical Assessment
