# Year 4, Term 2: Complete 16-bit Hardware (ALL HARDWARE COMPLETION)

## Overview

Term 2 of Year 4 completes ALL hardware construction before GCSE exams. Students build the complete 65C816 system including memory banking, I/O subsystems, and graphics/sound selection. **This term must complete all hardware by Week 27 (before GCSE exam period in Term 3).**

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Term 2, students will:
- Understand the 65C816 CPU architecture
- Design and build a complete 65C816 breadboard system
- Implement memory banking
- Integrate I/O subsystems
- Select graphics and sound solutions
- **Complete all hardware before GCSE exams**

- Oscilloscope (highly recommended)
- EEPROM programmer
- Breadboards (multiple)

## Assessment

- **Formative**: Weekly progress checkpoints
- **Summative**: Architecture comparison (Weeks 10-12)
- **Summative**: System design project (Weeks 13-15)
- **Summative**: Prototype construction (Weeks 16-18)
- **Summative**: Memory banking (Weeks 19-21)
- **Summative**: I/O integration (Weeks 22-24)
- **Summative**: Graphics/sound selection (Weeks 25-27)
- **Final**: Complete hardware system demonstration (Week 27)
- **CRITICAL**: All hardware must be complete by Week 27

## Prerequisites

Students must have completed Term 1 and understand:
- Complete CPU architecture (from SAP-1)
- Memory systems and addressing
- I/O systems
- System design principles

## Key Concepts

- **65C816 Architecture**: Modern 16-bit CPU
- **System Design**: Designing around commercial CPU
- **Memory Banking**: Expanding beyond 64KB
- **I/O Integration**: Serial, parallel, displays
- **Hardware Completion**: All hardware finished before GCSEs

## Milestones

- **Week 12**: 65C816 architecture understood
- **Week 15**: System design complete
- **Week 18**: Working breadboard prototype
- **Week 21**: Memory banking functional
- **Week 24**: I/O subsystems integrated
- **Week 27**: **ALL HARDWARE COMPLETE** ✅ (Before GCSE exams)

## Critical Notes

- **Hardware must complete by Week 27** - Term 3 is GCSE exam period (no curriculum)
- All content compressed for maximum efficiency
- Focus on core functionality - advanced features can be added in software
- Breadboard prototype is sufficient - PCB phase eliminated
