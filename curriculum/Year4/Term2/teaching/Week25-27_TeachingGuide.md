## Teaching Strategies

### Differentiation

**Support for struggling students**:
- Provide research templates
- Step-by-step research guide
- Extra time for work
- Pair with stronger students
- Review concepts

**Extension for advanced students**:
- Advanced prototypes
- Multiple solution testing
- Cost optimization
- Help other students

### Common Misconceptions

1. **"Graphics must be high-res"**
   - Clarify: Start simple, expand
   - Show progression

2. **"Sound must be perfect"**
   - Clarify: Start basic, improve
   - Show evolution

3. **"Too complex to build"**
   - Clarify: Many have done it
   - Show examples

### Assessment Checkpoints

**Week 9**: Can students research video options?
**Week 10**: Can students research audio options?
**Week 11**: Can students prototype solutions?
**Week 12**: Are proposals complete?

## Resources

- Research templates
- Datasheet collection
- Project examples
- Proposal templates

## Next Year

After completing research, students will integrate selected solutions in Year 6.
