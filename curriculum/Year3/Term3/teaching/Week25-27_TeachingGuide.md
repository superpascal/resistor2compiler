## Teaching Strategies

### Differentiation

**Support for struggling students**:
- Provide documentation templates
- Simplify presentation requirements
- Extra time for work
- Pair with stronger students
- Support during presentation

**Extension for advanced students**:
- Advanced documentation
- Extended presentation
- Help other students
- Additional projects

### Common Misconceptions

1. **"We're done learning"**
   - Clarify: This is foundation
   - Year 4 builds on this

2. **"Documentation is optional"**
   - Clarify: Essential for complex systems
   - Professional practice

3. **"CPU is perfect"**
   - Clarify: Can always improve
   - Show optimization opportunities

### Assessment Checkpoints

**Week 33**: Can students test comprehensively?
**Week 34**: Can students optimize system?
**Week 35**: Can students create documentation?
**Week 36**: Are students ready to present?

## Final Assessment

**Portfolio Requirements**:
- Complete system documentation
- All lab reports
- Program examples
- Circuit diagrams
- Photos of system
- Reflection on learning

**Presentation Requirements**:
- System overview
- Key features
- Demonstration
- Challenges overcome
- Lessons learned

## Resources

- Documentation templates
- Presentation guidelines
- Portfolio checklist
- Year 4 preview materials

## Next Year

After completing Year 3, students are ready for Year 4: Enhanced 8-bit Systems and preparation for 16-bit architecture.
