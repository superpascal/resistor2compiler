## Lab Sessions

### Session 1: Final Testing (Week 33)

**Objective**: Complete comprehensive system testing

**Steps**:
1. Test all instructions
2. Test multiple programs
3. Test edge cases
4. Test at different speeds
5. Verify reliability
6. Document test results
7. Fix any remaining issues
8. Verify system complete

**Expected Result**: System fully tested and verified

**Troubleshooting**:
- If tests fail: Debug, fix, retest
- If issues found: Address systematically
- If optimization needed: Apply improvements

### Session 2: System Optimization (Week 34)

**Objective**: Optimize system performance and reliability

**Steps**:
1. Add decoupling capacitors
2. Improve signal integrity
3. Optimize timing
4. Improve power distribution
5. Test optimizations
6. Verify improvements
7. Document changes
8. Final system check

**Expected Result**: Optimized, reliable system

**Troubleshooting**:
- If optimization breaks things: Revert, try different approach
- If no improvement: May already be optimal
- If new issues: Fix before finalizing

### Session 3: Documentation Creation (Week 35)

**Objective**: Create professional documentation

**Steps**:
1. Create system architecture diagram
2. Create circuit diagrams
3. Document instruction set
4. Document microcode
5. Write user guide
6. Write technical manual
7. Create troubleshooting guide
8. Document all programs

**Expected Result**: Complete professional documentation

**Troubleshooting**:
- If documentation incomplete: Add missing sections
- If unclear: Simplify, add examples
- If format inconsistent: Use templates, standardize

### Session 4: Presentation and Portfolio (Week 36)

**Objective**: Present system and complete portfolio

**Steps**:
1. Prepare presentation
2. Practice demonstration
3. Present to class
4. Demonstrate programs
5. Answer questions
6. Complete portfolio
7. Reflect on learning
8. Celebrate achievements

**Expected Result**: Successful presentation, complete portfolio

**Troubleshooting**:
- If presentation issues: Adapt, continue
- If portfolio incomplete: Add missing items
- If questions difficult: Answer honestly, get help
