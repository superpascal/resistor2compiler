# Year 3, Term 1: SAP-1 Construction - Data Path

## Overview

Term 1 of Year 3 focuses on building the data path components of the SAP-1 (Simple As Possible 1) 8-bit computer. Students integrate all Year 1-2 knowledge to construct the core computing elements.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Term 1, students will:
- Review and integrate all Year 1-2 concepts
- Build the ALU subsystem (adder/subtractor with flags)
- Build the register file (A register, B register)
- Build the memory subsystem (RAM and MAR)
- Build the bus system connecting all components
- Understand how data flows through the system

## Week Structure

### Weeks 1-3: Review and ALU Subsystem (Compressed from 4 weeks)
- Review Year 1-2 concepts
- Build 4-bit adder/subtractor
- Add carry and zero flags
- Test ALU operations
- Integrate with registers

### Weeks 4-6: Register File and Buses (Compressed from 4 weeks)
- Build Register A and Register B
- Implement tri-state bus connections
- Build bus control logic
- Test register operations
- Verify bus protocol

### Weeks 7-9: Memory Subsystem (Compressed from 4 weeks)
- Build Memory Address Register (MAR)
- Connect memory chip (RAM/EEPROM)
- Implement address decoding
- Test read/write operations
- Integrate memory with data path

## Materials

### Components
- All components from Years 1-2
- Additional registers (74HC173 or 74HC574)
- Memory chips (74LS189 or 28C16 EEPROM)
- Tri-state buffers (74HC125/244)
- Logic gates for control
- LEDs for status display

### Tools
- Breadboards (multiple)
- Multimeter
- Logic analyzer (if available)
- Oscilloscope (optional)
- EEPROM programmer (if using EEPROM)

## Assessment

- **Formative**: Weekly module testing
- **Summative**: ALU subsystem project (Weeks 1-3)
- **Summative**: Register/bus subsystem project (Weeks 4-6)
- **Summative**: Memory subsystem project (Weeks 7-9)
- **Final**: Complete data path demonstration

## Prerequisites

Students must have completed Years 1-2 and understand:
- All logic gates and combinational circuits
- Sequential logic (flip-flops, registers, counters)
- Memory concepts (MAR, read/write operations)
- Control signals and bus protocols
- System integration principles

## Key Concepts

- **Data Path**: The route data takes through the CPU
- **ALU**: Performs arithmetic and logic operations
- **Registers**: Store data temporarily
- **Memory**: Stores instructions and data
- **Buses**: Connect all components together
- **Control Signals**: Coordinate data movement

## Milestones

- **Week 4**: ALU complete and tested
- **Week 8**: Register file and buses complete
- **Week 12**: Complete data path integrated and tested
