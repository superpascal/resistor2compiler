# Ohm's Law Worksheet

**Name:** ________________________  
**Date:** ________________________  
**Week:** 1-2

## Part 1: Understanding the Formula

Ohm's Law: **V = I × R**

Where:
- **V** = Voltage (in Volts, V)
- **I** = Current (in Amperes, A)
- **R** = Resistance (in Ohms, Ω)

### Practice Problems

1. If voltage = 5V and resistance = 220Ω, what is the current?
   - I = V / R = ______ / ______ = ______ A = ______ mA

2. If voltage = 5V and current = 20mA, what resistance is needed?
   - R = V / I = ______ / ______ = ______ Ω

3. If resistance = 1kΩ and current = 5mA, what is the voltage?
   - V = I × R = ______ × ______ = ______ V

4. A LED needs 20mA at 2V. If we have 5V power, what resistor do we need?
   - Voltage across resistor = 5V - 2V = ______ V
   - Resistance = ______ / ______ = ______ Ω

## Part 2: Circuit Analysis

### Circuit 1: Simple LED Circuit

```

1. What is the voltage across the resistor? ______ V
2. What is the voltage across the LED? ______ V (typical LED forward voltage)
3. What is the current through the circuit? ______ mA
4. Is this current safe for a standard LED? (Yes/No) ______

### Circuit 2: Different Resistor Values

Fill in the table:

| Resistor Value | Current (mA) | LED Brightness |
|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| 100Ω           | ______       | ______         |
| 220Ω           | ______       | ______         |
| 470Ω           | ______       | ______         |
| 1kΩ            | ______       | ______         |

## Part 3: Measurements

Build the LED circuit and measure:

1. Voltage at power supply: ______ V
2. Voltage across resistor: ______ V
3. Voltage across LED: ______ V
4. Total voltage drop: ______ V (should equal power supply voltage)

## Part 4: Troubleshooting
