# Safety Guide - Quick Reference

## Electrical Safety Rules

### Always Follow These Rules

1. ✅ **Check connections before powering on**
2. ✅ **Never short-circuit power supplies**
3. ✅ **Report damaged equipment immediately**
4. ✅ **Keep water away from electronics**
5. ✅ **No food/drinks in lab**
6. ✅ **Use tools only for intended purpose**

### Voltage Limits

- **Safe for hands-on**: Up to 12 Volts
- **Our circuits use**: 5 Volts (safe!)
- **Never touch**: Anything above 12V
- **Wall outlets**: 120V - DANGEROUS! Never use!

### What to Do If...

**Component gets hot**:
- Turn off power immediately
- Let it cool
- Check for short circuit
- Report to teacher

**Smoke or smell**:
- Turn off power immediately
- Move away
- Tell teacher
- Don't touch until teacher says it's safe

**Circuit doesn't work**:
- Turn off power
- Check connections
- Use multimeter to diagnose
- Ask teacher for help

## Tool Safety

### Multimeter
- Always start in voltage mode (safest)
- Check mode before measuring
- Don't measure current in voltage mode (can damage meter)

### Breadboard
- Check for loose wires
- Ensure no shorts
- Keep clean and organized

### Power Supply
- Check voltage before connecting
- Never exceed component ratings
- Turn off when not in use

## Emergency Procedures

### If Someone Gets Shocked
1. **Don't touch them!** (You could get shocked too)
2. Turn off power source
3. Call teacher immediately
4. Teacher will provide first aid

### If There's a Fire
