## Overview

This guide links the theory and lab materials for Weeks 6-8, providing a complete teaching roadmap for Boolean Logic.

## Learning Objectives

Students will:
- Understand Boolean logic concepts
- Build and test logic gates
- Create truth tables
- Combine gates for complex logic
- Build diode-logic gates
- Apply logic to solve problems

## Suggested Lesson Flow

### Week 6, Session 1: Introduction to Boolean Logic (60-90 min)

**Timing**:
- Review: 5 min
- Theory: Boolean logic: 20 min
- Theory: Logic gates: 25 min
- Lab: Build AND gate: 20 min
- Wrap-up: 10 min

**Materials**:
- Theory: `theory/Term1/Week06-08_BooleanLogic.md`
- Lab: `labs/Term1/Lab06-08_BooleanLogic.md`
- Logic gate ICs (74HC08, 74HC32, 74HC04)

**Key Points**:
1. **Boolean logic**: Mathematics of true/false
2. **Binary world**: Only 0 and 1
3. **Logic gates**: Electronic circuits for Boolean operations

**Teaching Tips**:
- Use analogies (security system, door locks)
- Draw gate symbols on board
- Practice truth tables together
- Build along with students

**Common Questions**:
- "Why binary?" → Easy for electronics
- "What's the difference between AND and OR?" → AND = both, OR = either
- "Why learn this?" → Foundation of computers

### Week 6, Session 2: OR and NOT Gates (60-90 min)

**Timing**:
- Review: 5 min
- Lab: OR gate: 25 min
- Lab: NOT gate: 25 min
- Lab: Combining gates: 20 min
- Wrap-up: 10 min

**Materials**:
- Logic gate ICs
- Switches, LEDs

**Key Points**:
1. **OR gate**: More permissive than AND
2. **NOT gate**: Inverts input
3. **Combining gates**: Build complex logic

**Teaching Tips**:
- Compare AND vs OR side-by-side
- Demonstrate NOT with inverter chain
- Show how to combine gates
- Celebrate first complex circuit!

**Common Issues**:
- Confusing AND and OR → Use analogies
- NOT gate confusing → Show with LED (inverted)
- Combining gates → Build step-by-step

### Week 7, Session 1: XOR and Complex Logic (60-90 min)

**Timing**:
- Review: 5 min
- Theory: XOR gate: 25 min
- Lab: Build XOR: 20 min
- Lab: Complex circuits: 30 min
- Wrap-up: 10 min

**Materials**:
- 74HC86 (XOR)
- Multiple gate ICs for complex circuits

**Key Points**:
1. **XOR**: "One or the other, but not both"
2. **Complex logic**: Combine multiple gates
3. **Real applications**: Security, voting, control

**Teaching Tips**:
- Use XOR puzzle to engage
- Build complex circuits step-by-step
- Test thoroughly
- Discuss real-world applications

**Common Questions**:
- "When do I use XOR?" → When inputs must differ
- "How do I design complex circuits?" → Break into parts
- "Why so many gates?" → Each does one thing

### Week 7, Session 2: Diode Logic (60-90 min)

**Timing**:
- Review: 5 min
- Theory: Diode logic: 15 min
- Lab: Build diode-OR: 30 min
- Lab: Compare to IC: 15 min
- Wrap-up: 10 min

**Materials**:
- Diodes (1N4148)
- Resistors
- Logic gate ICs for comparison

**Key Points**:
1. **Diode logic**: Simple gate construction
2. **Limitations**: Voltage drop, not perfect
3. **Why ICs better**: Precise, fast, reliable

**Teaching Tips**:
- Show how gates work inside
- Demonstrate limitations
- Compare to IC gates
- Historical context

**Common Questions**:
- "Why learn diode logic?" → Understand how gates work
- "Is it as good as ICs?" → No, but educational
- "Can I build AND with diodes?" → Not easily

### Week 8, Session 1: Assessment (60-90 min)

**Timing**:
- Review: 10 min
- Practical assessment: 40 min
- Written assessment: 20 min
- Wrap-up: 10 min

**Materials**:
- Assessment materials
- Components for building

**Assessment Tasks**:
1. Build and test gates
2. Design logic circuit
3. Written quiz

## Differentiation Strategies

### Support for Struggling Students

**Theory**:
- Extra practice with truth tables
- Simplified explanations
- More analogies
- One-on-one support

**Lab**:
- Pre-built gates to analyze
- Step-by-step guidance
- Extra time
- Pair with stronger student

### Extension for Advanced Students

**Theory**:
- Boolean algebra
- Advanced simplification
- Research gate families

**Lab**:
- Build 3-input gates
- Design custom functions
- Advanced: Build from transistors
- Research projects

## Assessment Integration

### Formative Assessment

**During Lessons**:
- Truth table completion
- Gate building observation
- Circuit design ability
- Understanding checks

### Summative Assessment

**End of Week 8**:
- Practical: Build circuits
- Written: Concepts quiz
- Portfolio: Lab notebook

## Common Misconceptions

1. **"OR means both"**
   - Actually: OR means either
   - AND means both

2. **"Logic gates are complicated"**
   - Actually: They're just switches
   - Simple when understood

3. **"All gates need same inputs"**
   - Actually: NOT has one input
   - Gates have different inputs

4. **"Diode logic is as good as ICs"**
   - Actually: ICs are better
   - Diode logic is educational

## Resources Needed

**For Theory**:
- Theory reading material
- Whiteboard/markers
- Gate symbol charts

**For Lab**:
- Logic gate ICs (74HC series)
- Switches, LEDs
- Diodes (for diode logic)
- Multimeters

## Connection to Next Week

**Week 9-12 Preview**:
- This week: Basic logic gates
- Next week: Combinational circuits (adders, MUX, decoder)
- Build on: Gate understanding, truth tables
