# Week 1-2: Teaching Guide

## Overview

This guide links the theory and lab materials for Weeks 1-2, providing a complete teaching roadmap.

## Learning Objectives

Students will:
- Understand electricity fundamentals (theory)
- Build their first circuit (lab)
- Use lab equipment safely
- Apply Ohm's law practically

## Suggested Lesson Flow

### Session 1: Theory Introduction (45 min)

**Timing**:
- Introduction: 5 min
- Theory presentation: 30 min
- Q&A and review: 10 min

**Materials**:
- Theory reading: `theory/Term1/Week01-02_ElectricityBasics.md`
- Whiteboard/markers
- Demonstrations (battery, multimeter, components)

**Key Points to Emphasize**:
1. **Voltage, Current, Resistance analogy** (water in pipe)
   - This helps students visualize abstract concepts
   - Use it throughout the session

2. **Ohm's Law** (V = I × R)
   - Show with examples
   - Practice calculations together
   - Emphasize: If voltage fixed, resistance controls current

3. **Why resistors are needed**
   - LEDs need specific current
   - Too much current = burn out
   - Resistor protects LED

4. **Safety is non-negotiable**
   - Review rules clearly
   - Explain why each rule exists
   - Get safety agreement signed

**Teaching Tips**:
- Use analogies liberally (water, traffic, etc.)
- Draw diagrams on board
- Use real components as props
- Check understanding frequently
- Answer questions thoroughly

**Common Questions**:
- "Why 5V?" → Safe, standard for digital circuits
- "What if I use wrong resistor?" → LED might burn or be dim
- "Is this dangerous?" → 5V is safe, but follow rules anyway

### Session 2: Lab Equipment Introduction (60 min)

**Timing**:
- Safety briefing: 15 min

   - Power supply: Show connection, measure output

3. **Hands-on Practice**:
   - Students practice with each tool
   - Teacher circulates and helps
   - Ensure everyone comfortable before moving on

**Teaching Tips**:
- Safety briefing is mandatory - don't skip!
- Let students explore equipment
- Answer questions as they arise
- Check that everyone understands before proceeding

### Session 3: First Circuit Build (90 min)

**Timing**:
- Review theory: 10 min
- Build circuit: 40 min

- Troubleshooting: 15 min
- Wrap-up: 5 min

**Materials**:
- Lab guide: `labs/Term1/Lab01-02_LabIntroduction.md`
- Components for each student/team
- Multimeters

**Teaching Sequence**:

1. **Quick Theory Review** (10 min)
   - Review Ohm's law
   - Why resistor needed
   - Circuit basics

2. **Guided Build** (40 min)
   - Follow lab guide step-by-step
   - Teacher demonstrates first
   - Students build with support
   - Check each step before proceeding

3. **Measurement Practice** (20 min)
   - Students measure voltages
   - Teacher helps interpret results
   - Verify calculations

4. **Troubleshooting** (15 min)
   - If circuits work: Great! Move to extension
   - If problems: Use troubleshooting guide
   - Teach systematic debugging

**Teaching Tips**:
- Build along with students (show on board/projector)
- Check connections before power-on (safety!)
- Celebrate first working circuit!
- Use problems as teaching moments

**Common Issues**:
- LED backwards → Most common! Use as teaching moment
- Loose connections → Show how to check
- Wrong resistor → Explain why it matters
- Power supply issues → Check connections

### Session 4: Experimentation and Assessment (90 min)

**Timing**:
- Experiments: 40 min
- Assessment: 40 min
- Reflection: 10 min

**Materials**:
- Additional resistors
- Assessment materials
- Lab notebooks

**Activities**:
1. **Experiments** (from lab guide)
   - Different resistor values
   - Measurements
   - Troubleshooting practice

2. **Assessment**:
   - Practical: Build circuit
   - Written: Concepts quiz
   - Portfolio: Lab notebook

3. **Reflection**:
   - What was challenging?
   - What did you learn?
   - What questions remain?

## Differentiation Strategies

### Support for Struggling Students

**Theory**:
- Provide simplified explanations
- Use more analogies
- Extra practice with Ohm's law
- One-on-one support

**Lab**:
- Pair with stronger student
- Pre-built circuit to analyze
- Step-by-step guidance
- Extra time

### Extension for Advanced Students

**Theory**:
- Power calculations (P = V × I)
- Series/parallel circuits (preview)
- Component datasheets
- Research applications

**Lab**:
- Multiple LEDs
- LED chaser circuit
- Design challenges
- Research projects

## Assessment Integration

### Formative Assessment (During Lessons)

**Theory Session**:
- Quick checks: "What is voltage?"
- Practice problems
- Concept questions

**Lab Session**:
- Observation of building
- Measurement accuracy
- Troubleshooting ability
- Safety compliance

### Summative Assessment (End of Week)

**Practical**:
- Build LED circuit independently
- Measure voltages accurately
- Explain operation

**Written**:
- Safety rules
- Ohm's law calculations
- Circuit analysis

**Portfolio**:
- Lab notebook entries
- Circuit documentation
- Reflection

## Common Misconceptions to Address

1. **"More voltage = brighter LED"**
   - Actually: More current = brighter
   - Voltage is fixed, resistor controls current

2. **"LEDs work both ways"**
   - No! They have polarity
   - Must connect correctly

3. **"Resistors are optional"**
   - No! They protect components
   - Essential for circuit operation

4. **"Circuits are complicated"**
   - Start simple, build complexity
   - This is just the beginning!

## Resources Needed

**For Theory**:
- Theory reading material
- Whiteboard/markers
- Demonstration components
- Calculator (for Ohm's law)

**For Lab**:
- Components (LEDs, resistors, wires)
- Breadboards
- Multimeters
- Power supplies
- Safety equipment

## Timing Flexibility

**Fast Track** (if students ready):
- Combine theory and lab in same session
- Move to experiments earlier
- Add extension activities

**Extended Track** (if students need more time):
- Extra practice sessions
- Additional examples
- More hands-on time
- Review and reinforcement

## Connection to Next Week

**Week 3-5 Preview**:
- This week: Basic circuits
- Next week: Components (resistors, capacitors, 555 timer)
- Build on: Ohm's law, circuit building, measurement skills

**Preparation**:
- Review component theory before next lab
- Ensure all students comfortable with basics
- Address any gaps before moving on
