# Year 1, Term 2: Sequential Logic and Building Blocks

## Overview

Term 2 introduces sequential logic - circuits that have memory and change state over time. This is fundamental to understanding how computers store and process information.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Term 2, students will:
- Understand sequential vs combinational logic
- Build latches and flip-flops
- Create multi-bit registers
- Build binary counters
- Understand system buses and tri-state buffers
- Build a simple ALU subsystem
- Understand how computers store and process data
