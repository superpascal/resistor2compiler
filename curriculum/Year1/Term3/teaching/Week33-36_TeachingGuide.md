# Week 33-36: Teaching Guide

## Overview

This guide links the theory and lab materials for Weeks 33-36, providing a complete teaching roadmap for Integration and Review - the culmination of Year 1!

## Learning Objectives

Students will:
- Integrate all Year 1 concepts into complete system
- Execute programs manually on manual computer
- Troubleshoot complete systems
- Document complete projects
- Reflect on Year 1 learning journey
- Prepare for Year 2 and Year 3

## Suggested Lesson Flow

### Week 33, Session 1: Complete System Integration (60-90 min)

**Timing**:
- Review: 5 min
- Theory: Integration: 30 min
- Lab: Build complete system: 40 min
- Wrap-up: 10 min

**Materials**:
- Theory: `theory/Term3/Week33-36_Integration.md`
- Lab: `labs/Term3/Lab33-36_Integration.md`
- All components from Year 1

**Key Points**:
1. **Integration**: All subsystems together
2. **Verification**: Test each subsystem first
3. **Connection**: Connect via bus
4. **Testing**: Test complete system

**Teaching Tips**:
- Start with checklist
- Verify each subsystem
- Connect systematically
- Test thoroughly
- Celebrate integration!

**Common Questions**:
- "How complex?" → Build step-by-step
- "What if it doesn't work?" → Systematic troubleshooting
- "Is this a real computer?" → Manual computer, demonstrates concepts

### Week 33, Session 2: Program Execution (60-90 min)

**Timing**:
- Review: 5 min
- Theory: Program execution: 25 min
- Lab: Write programs: 30 min
- Lab: Execute programs: 25 min
- Wrap-up: 10 min

**Materials**:
- Complete integrated system
- Program examples

**Key Points**:
1. **Programs**: Sequence of operations
2. **Execution**: Step-by-step
3. **Verification**: Check results
4. **Documentation**: Record everything

**Teaching Tips**:
- Start with simple programs
- Execute step-by-step
- Observe data flow
- Verify results
- Celebrate first program!

**Common Issues**:
- Wrong results → Check each step
- Timing issues → Verify signals
- Confusion → Go step-by-step

### Week 34: Troubleshooting and Documentation

**Timing**: As needed for troubleshooting and documentation

### Week 35-36: Final Assessment and Review

**Timing**: As needed for assessment and Year 1 completion

## Differentiation Strategies

### Support for Struggling Students

**Theory**:
- Extra review
- Simplified explanations
- More examples

**Lab**:
- Pre-built subsystems
- Step-by-step guidance
- Extra time
- Pair support

### Extension for Advanced Students

**Theory**:
- Research real CPUs
- Advanced concepts

**Lab**:
- More complex programs
- Optimize system
- Research improvements
- Help others

## Assessment Integration

### Formative Assessment

**During Lessons**:
- Integration observation
- Program execution
- Troubleshooting ability
- Documentation quality

### Summative Assessment

**End of Year 1**:
- Practical: Complete system
- Written: Comprehensive exam
- Portfolio: Complete documentation
- Presentation: System demonstration

## Common Misconceptions

1. **"Integration is hard"**
   - Actually: Just connect subsystems
   - Build step-by-step

2. **"Programs are complicated"**
   - Actually: Just sequences of operations
   - Start simple

3. **"Troubleshooting is guesswork"**
   - Actually: Systematic approach
   - Methodical process

## Resources Needed

**For Theory**:
- Theory reading material
- Integration diagrams
- Whiteboard/markers

**For Lab**:
- All Year 1 components
- Documentation materials
- Camera (for documentation)

## Year 1 Completion

**Celebrate**:
- Complete system built
- Programs executed
- Concepts mastered
- Ready for Year 2!

**Reflection**:
- What did you learn?
- What was challenging?
- What was exciting?
- How does this prepare for Year 2?
