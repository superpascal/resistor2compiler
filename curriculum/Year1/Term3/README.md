# Year 1, Term 3: Integration and Preparation for CPU Building

## Overview

Term 3 integrates all concepts from Terms 1 and 2, introduces memory concepts, and prepares students for building a complete CPU in Year 3. This term focuses on bringing everything together.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Term 3, students will:
- Understand memory chips and addressing
- Build memory address registers
- Understand control concepts
- Build simple state machines
- Integrate all subsystems
- Build a "manual computer"
- Be ready to build SAP-1 CPU in Year 3

## Week-by-Week Structure

- **Weeks 25-28**: Memory and the MAR (Memory Address Register)
- **Weeks 29-32**: Control Unit Concepts and State Machines
- **Weeks 33-36**: Integration - Manual Computer and Review

## Key Concepts

### Memory
- Memory chips (EEPROM, RAM)
- Address decoding
- Reading and writing
- Memory maps

### Control
- Control signals
- State machines
- Sequencing
- Microcode concepts (introduction)

### Integration
- Complete system
- Manual operation
- Signal coordination
- Preparation for automation

## Prerequisites

- Completed Terms 1 and 2
- Understanding of:
  - All combinational circuits
  - All sequential circuits
  - Buses and tri-state
  - ALU subsystem

## Assessment

- Weekly practical assessments
- Memory subsystem demonstration
- Control system demonstration
- Final: Manual computer demonstration
- Portfolio: Complete Year 1 documentation

## Materials

- Memory chips (EEPROM, small RAM)
- Address decoders
- Registers and latches
- All materials from Terms 1-2

## Progression

Term 3 completes Year 1:
- Term 1: Combinational logic
- Term 2: Sequential logic
- Term 3: Memory and control (integration)

**Year 1 Achievement**: Students understand all hardware building blocks and are ready to build a CPU!
