## Complete System Integration

### All Subsystems

**Year 1 Components**:
- Combinational circuits (adders, MUX, decoder)
- Sequential circuits (flip-flops, registers, counters)
- Bus system with tri-state control
- ALU subsystem (registers, adder, flags)
- Memory system (memory, MAR)
- Program Counter
- Control system (manual or sequencer)

### Integration Steps

**1. Verify Each Subsystem**:
- Test each subsystem independently
- Ensure all work correctly
- Fix any issues before integration

**2. Connect Subsystems**:
- Connect via bus system
- Add tri-state buffers
- Ensure proper connections

**3. Add Control Signals**:
- Connect control to all subsystems
- Verify signal routing
- Test control operation

**4. Test Integrated Operations**:
- Test complete operations
- Verify data flow
- Check timing

**5. Debug Any Issues**:
- Systematic troubleshooting
- Check each connection
- Verify signals
- Fix problems

## Manual Computer

### What is a Manual Computer?

**Manual computer**:
- All subsystems integrated
- Manual control (switches)
- Can execute simple programs
- Demonstrates computer operation

### Components

**Data Path**:
- Registers (A, B)
- ALU (adder, flags)
- Memory (RAM, MAR)
- Bus system

**Control**:
- Manual switches
- Or simple sequencer
- Coordinates operations

**Display**:
- LEDs for data
- LEDs for addresses
- LEDs for flags
- Status indicators

### Operation

**Manual Execution**:
- Set control signals manually
- Step-by-step execution
- Observe data flow
- Understand operation

**Program Execution**:
- Load program into memory
- Execute step-by-step
- Observe results
- Verify correctness

---

## Program Execution

### Writing Programs

**Simple Program**: Add two numbers
1. Load A from memory[5] (value: 7)
2. Load B from memory[6] (value: 9)
3. Add A + B
4. Store result to memory[7]
5. Expected: memory[7] = 16

**Program Steps**:
- Each step = sequence of control signals
- Manual or automated execution
- Observe data flow
- Verify results

### Executing Programs

**Step-by-step**:
1. Set control signals for step 1
2. Observe data flow
3. Verify operation
4. Move to next step
5. Repeat until complete

**Verification**:
- Check intermediate results
- Verify final result
- Debug if needed
- Document execution

## Troubleshooting

### Systematic Approach

**1. Identify Problem**:
- What doesn't work?
- When does it fail?
- What's the symptom?

**2. Isolate Subsystem**:
- Test subsystems independently
- Find which subsystem has problem
- Narrow down issue

**3. Check Connections**:
- Verify all connections
- Check power
- Check signals
- Check timing

**4. Fix and Verify**:
- Fix identified problem
- Test again
- Verify solution
- Document fix

### Common Issues

**Bus Contention**:
- Multiple drivers active
- Check enable signals
- Verify only one active

**Timing Issues**:
- Signals not synchronized
- Check clock
- Verify timing

**Wrong Data**:
- Check connections
- Verify signals
- Check logic
