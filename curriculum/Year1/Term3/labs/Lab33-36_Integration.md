# Lab 33-36: Integration and Review

## Lab Overview

**Duration**: 4 weeks (8-12 hours total)  
**Prerequisites**: Read theory material on Integration and Review  
**Outcome**: Integrate all subsystems, execute programs, and complete Year 1

## Safety Reminders

- [ ] Check all connections before powering on
- [ ] Verify IC orientation (notch indicates pin 1)
- [ ] Never short-circuit power supplies
- [ ] Use correct voltage (5V for 74HC series)

## Lab Session 1: Complete System Integration (60-90 min)

### Part 1: Integration Checklist (30 min)

**Activity**: Verify all subsystems
- [ ] Power and clock systems
- [ ] Combinational circuits (adders, MUX, decoder)
- [ ] Sequential circuits (flip-flops, registers, counters)
- [ ] Bus system with tri-state control
- [ ] ALU subsystem (registers, adder, flags)
- [ ] Memory system (memory, MAR)
- [ ] Program Counter
- [ ] Control system (manual or sequencer)

**Check**: Are all subsystems ready?

### Part 2: Building Complete System (40 min)

**Activity**: Assemble complete manual computer
- Connect all subsystems
- Add all control switches
- Add all displays
- Create control panel
- Test each connection

**Testing**:
- Test each subsystem
- Test bus operation
- Check control signals
- Verify all connections

**Check**: Does complete system work?

## Lab Session 2: Program Execution (60-90 min)

### Part 1: Writing Simple Programs (30 min)

**Program 1**: Add two numbers
- Load A from memory[5] (value: 7)
- Load B from memory[6] (value: 9)
- Add A + B
- Store result to memory[7]
- Expected: memory[7] = 16

**Program 2**: Subtract
- Load A from memory[8] (value: 10)
- Load B from memory[9] (value: 3)
- Subtract A - B
- Store result to memory[10]
- Expected: memory[10] = 7

**Check**: Do you understand the programs?

### Part 2: Executing Programs (30 min)

**Activity**: Execute programs manually
- Step through each instruction
- Set control signals for each step
- Observe data flow
- Verify results
- Document execution

**Check**: Can you execute programs correctly?

---

- Verify solution

**Check**: Can you troubleshoot effectively?

### Part 2: Debugging Practice (30 min)

**Activity**: Debug real issues
- Find problems in system
- Isolate subsystems
- Check connections
- Fix issues
- Document solutions

**Check**: Can you debug systems?

---

## Lab Session 4: Documentation (60-90 min)

### Part 1: System Documentation (30 min)

**Activity**: Document complete system
- Draw block diagram
- List all components
- Document connections
- Document control signals
