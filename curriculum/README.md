## Curriculum Philosophy

This curriculum follows a **progressive disclosure** approach:
- **Years 1-2**: Foundational electronics and logic (ages 13-14) - no programming pressure
- **Years 3-4**: CPU construction and enhancement (ages 15-16) - GCSE years
- **Years 5-6**: Advanced systems and software (ages 17-18) - A-Level years

Each lesson plan includes:
- **Learning Objectives** - What students will know/understand/do
- **Prerequisites** - Required prior knowledge
- **Materials** - Components, tools, and resources needed
- **Activities** - Step-by-step hands-on tasks
- **Assessment** - How learning is measured
- **Differentiation** - Support for varying ability levels
- **Extension** - Challenges for advanced students

## Usage

Teachers should:
1. Review the year overview (`YearX/README.md`)
2. Prepare materials listed in each lesson plan
3. Follow the lesson sequence, adapting pace as needed
4. Use assessments to track student progress
5. Refer to worksheets and resources as needed

## Offline-First Design

All materials are designed for offline use:
- No internet dependency
- Printable worksheets
- Self-contained activities
- Reference materials included

## Assessment Philosophy

Assessment is **formative and project-based**:
- Weekly practical assessments
- Term projects demonstrating understanding
- Year-end capstone projects
- Portfolio documentation of learning journey
