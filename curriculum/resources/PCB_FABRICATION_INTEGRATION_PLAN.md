# PCB Fabrication Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for integrating DIY PCB fabrication methods into the formative years (Years 2-4) of the curriculum, preparing students for professional PCB manufacturing in Year 6.

**Core Philosophy**: **Breadboard → PCB Iterative Approach**
- Students build and test circuits on breadboards first
- Once functional, students create DIY PCBs for those circuits
- Components are migrated from breadboard to PCB
- This teaches industrialization early and makes student work permanent

**Why This Matters**:
- Breadboards are fragile and wires don't stay in place
- Students learn to industrialize their work from early years
- Creates permanent, reliable versions of working circuits
- Builds professional engineering mindset
- Prepares for professional manufacturing in Year 6

## Integration Strategy

### Iterative Breadboard → PCB Workflow

**Process for Each Project**:
1. **Design & Build**: Create circuit on breadboard
2. **Test & Debug**: Verify functionality on breadboard
3. **Document**: Document working breadboard circuit
4. **PCB Design**: Create PCB layout from breadboard circuit
5. **PCB Fabrication**: Create DIY PCB using toner transfer/etching
6. **Migration**: Move components from breadboard to PCB
7. **Test & Verify**: Verify PCB works identically to breadboard
8. **Compare**: Document differences (reliability, durability, professionalism)

**Benefits**:
- Students see immediate value (permanent, reliable circuit)
- Learn industrialization process early
- Understand why professional manufacturing matters
- Build portfolio of permanent projects
- Develop professional engineering mindset

### Two-Track Approach
